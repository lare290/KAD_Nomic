Rule 1: Players may propose new rules and changes to rules. A majority vote decides whether the proposal is accepted or not.
Rule 2: Anyone with the @nomic role is considered to be a player.
Rule 3: To keep the proposal channel tidy, voting is to be done using the :white_check_mark: or :no_entry_sign: emojis to symbolize a vote for or against a rules proposal respectively.
Rule 4: Only votes via emoji from Players are to be counted towards rules proposals being accepted or rejected.
Rule 5: The current rules of this Nomic are considered to be the ones in https://github.com/lare290/KAD_Nomic/blob/main/Rules. Any other rules claiming to be rules of this Nomic are considered to be only copies and thus not legally binding.
Rule 6: Create a channel which lists all active rules, maintained by a duly elected scribe.
Rule 7: The voting for any specific proposal is to take place during a 1 hour period, henceforth referred to as the voting period. During this time votes for and against the proposal may be cast and retracted at will, but at the end of this voting period the current totals of votes cast for and against the proposal are what are counted for the majority vote meant by rule 1. Additionally, if at any point a proposal has a 2/3 majority as counted by the votes cast, it passes immediately.
