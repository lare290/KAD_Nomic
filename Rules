Rule 1: Players may propose new rules and changes to rules. A majority vote decides whether the proposal is accepted or not.
Rule 2: Anyone with the @nomic role is considered to be a player.
Rule 3: To keep the proposal channel tidy, voting is to be done using the :white_check_mark: or :no_entry_sign: emojis to symbolize a vote for or against a rules proposal respectively.
Rule 4: Only votes via emoji from Players are to be counted towards rules proposals being accepted or rejected.
Rule 5: The current rules of this Nomic are considered to be the ones in https://github.com/lare290/KAD_Nomic/blob/main/Rules. Any other rules claiming to be rules of this Nomic are considered to be only copies and thus not legally binding.
Rule 6: Create a channel which lists all active rules, maintained by a duly elected scribe.
Rule 7: The voting for any specific proposal is to take place during a 1 hour period, henceforth referred to as the voting period. During this time votes for and against the proposal may be cast and retracted at will, but at the end of this voting period the current totals of votes cast for and against the proposal are what are counted for the majority vote meant by rule 1. Additionally, if at any point a proposal has a 2/3 majority as counted by the votes cast, it passes immediately.
Rule 8: All Players are to be assigned three statistics -- henceforth "stats" -- entitled Health, Attack and Defense. These stats are to be initialized at the value 100 for the purpose of performing mathematics on them. For all intents and purposes, a Player's stats are to be considered inherent aspects of their being.
Rule 9: Actions which are within the bounds of the rules as written -- at the time the action is taken -- are to be considered Legal and everything that falls outside those bounds is to be considered Illegal. Illegal actions may be taken at the risk of a FAULT.
Rule 10: Taken Illegal actions may be called out by another Player by calling a FAULT on that Player's Illegal Action. When a FAULT is declared, the Player who called the FAULT -- henceforth the Fault-caller -- and the Player(s) who is/are the target of the FAULT --henceforth the Guilty -- are to go to a new channel (#court) wherein the Fault-caller may make their case as to what the Guilty has/have done in reference to their Illegal Actions Taken. The outcome of a FAULT may end in one of three ways; The Fault-caller is in the wrong, The Guilty is/are in the wrong, or No one is in the wrong. In the case that a party is found to be in the wrong, they must pay recompense to the wronged party and rescind their Illegal Action. The decider of such outcomes is to be the holder of the title of Judge, which is passed from Player to Player based on alphabetical order (of the English language) of their names. In the event that a Fault-caller or Guilty are Judge, they must pass on their Judgeship before participating in the FAULT. Participation in a FAULT is mandatory once it has been called.
Rule 11: All proposals are to be in the form of 'Proposal n: [action]' Where n is a number assigned to the proposal, these numbers should be in a strictly rising sequence in which 1 is the number of the first proposal and every other proposal having a number exactly 1 larger than the previous, and [action] is the description of what should happen in the game, for example 'Proposal 2: Add a rule containing "Every player should own a computer to be able to access Discord".' Anything that does not follow this form is considered to not be a legal proposal.
Rule 0: If two rules are found to be in direct conflict with each other such that only one of them may be partially or fully followed without breaking the rules, the one with the larger number is considered to be void in the conflicting parts.
For this purpose, each rule is to be assigned a number. This rule is to be assigned the number 0, all other rules are to be assigned the numbers they are currently labeled as on Github, and every new rule that is added is to be assigned a number 1 larger than the previous largest rule number.
Rule 12: A proposal may be used to cause a game action to happen. Whether the action takes place is to be determined by a majority vote as outlined in other rules. For this purpose game actions are considered to be
-adding a new rule or rules
-changing an existing rule or rules
-removing an existing rule or rules
-appointing an office or offices. If the office in question is currently occupied, the current owner of the title will lose it and it is transferred to the person appointed
For this purpose offices are considered to be
-judge
-scribe
New game actions and offices may be defined in other rules.
